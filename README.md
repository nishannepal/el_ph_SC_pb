This is the example of calculating momentum dependent electron phonon coupling and superconductivity ( that is calculated using Allen-Dynes modified McMillan fourmula for superconductivity).
1) First, a scf calculation with highly dense K-mesh. ( pb.scf.fit.in )
2) Normal scf ( pb.scf.in)
3) elph.in
4) q2r.in
5) matdyn.in
6) lambda.in
7) Estimation of Tc is in lambda.out file.
